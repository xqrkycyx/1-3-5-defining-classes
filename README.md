# Defining classes

Define a `Student` class (in `student.js`) which has these attributes:

- `firstName`: (`string`)
- `lastName`: (`string`)
- `birthYear`: (`number`)
- `birthMonth`: (`number`)
- `birthDay`: (`number`)
- `gender`: (`string`)

The constructor should take the parameters in the same order as above. A new instance of the `Student` class will be created as follows:

```
new Student("Mary", "Lee", 2000, 1, 1, "female");

```
